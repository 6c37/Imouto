# Imouto

## What is Imouto?
Imouto is a collection of stylesheets for several websites.

The stylesheets are very "DIY", the code is meant to be as clean as possible, in order to allow advanced users to do the customization they want.

You can use them as a base to create your own custom theme.

## Planned features
See [TODO](https://github.com/SkyCorp/Imouto/blob/master/TODO).

## Info about support
Firefox is the only supported browser and Stylish is the only supported extension.
Support for other browsers and extensions is not considered at the present time.

## Other
Feel free to submit feedback! And as always, use the issues tracker if you run into any nasty bugs with the base CSS.
