Imouto
======

4chan CSS for use with [noface's 4chan X](http://ihavenoface.github.io/4chan-x/)


This CSS is meant to be a base for you to use in order to create your own custom theme.
Imouto is pure CSS, its code is meant to be as clean as possible, in order to allow advanced users to do the customization they want. 
It is very "DIY" and the only option of customizability is to edit the source code manually.

***
Planned features: see [TODO](https://github.com/SkyCorp/Imouto/blob/master/TODO)
Feel free to submit feedback! this helps us improve the default code.
And as always, use the issues tracker if you run into any nasty bugs with the base css.
