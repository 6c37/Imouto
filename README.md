Imouto
======

4chan CSS for use with [noface's 4chan X](http://ihavenoface.github.io/4chan-x/)


This CSS is meant to be a base for you to use in order to create your own custom theme.
Imouto is pure CSS, it's code is meant to be as clean as possible, in order to allow advanced CSS users to do the customization they want. 
It is written with the Suckless Philoshopy in mind, and as such very DIY and it offers no options of customizablity, apart from editing the source code directly.

***
Planned features: see [TODO](https://github.com/SkyCorp/Imouto/blob/master/TODO)
Feel free to submit feedback! this helps us improve the default code.
And as always, use the issues tracker if you run into any nasty bugs with the base css.
